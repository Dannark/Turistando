3. Users Profile

### AWS Webserver API
The app uses a web server API build in node js hosted in AWS for testing purpose

The main objective with this app is to demonstrate how to develop and struct a good architecture with Android kotlin that is scalable and easy to maintain.

The server folder is on the root projet `nodejs_webserver` and you can start it by using the command `npm start`
You can also use the Online API instead of hosting on your localhost with the link:

`http://ec2-18-224-184-195.us-east-2.compute.amazonaws.com:3335/`

Endpoints are:
    - /places
    - /posts
    - /users

If you want to get the closest places near your location, you will also need to setup a `Google Places API` in your Google Developer Account in order to test that feature.
Just put yout api key on `PlacesApi` class
